# Airbnb-Price-Predictor-R-Model
This analysis aims to assist aspiring hosts in establishing pricing for their Airbnb listings in Asheville, NC, by creating a predictive model based on historical Airbnb data. By applying this model, I aim to assist new hosts in understanding and leveraging these variables to set competitive and market-aligned prices for their listings, thereby fulfilling our project goal of aiding hosts in optimizing their pricing strategies.
